## Overview
**Sastamah** is a lifestyle application crafted to simplify daily routines through efficient, collaborative reminder management. The app enables users to not only create personal reminders but also send recurring (recursive) reminders to friends â€” enhancing both productivity and meaningful social connections.

Unlike traditional task apps, Sastamah brings a social layer to organization, allowing users to stay connected and motivate each other through shared reminders.
