# Tazj – Fresh Grocery Delivery App (UAE)

## Overview

Tazj is a UAE-based, multi-vendor grocery delivery app that connects users with local sellers offering fresh, organic produce, meats, fish, and more—all delivered on the same day at market prices. The platform is unique in its vendor-first experience, where users choose a vendor before browsing products.

This version of the app was a complete rebuild from the ground up, unrelated to the legacy system and developed with modern architecture and scalability in mind. The multilingual system launched with English and Arabic, and was designed to support any number of languages in the future.

## My Contributions

As the sole backend developer on the project, I led the full redevelopment of the platform’s backend:

- Designed and implemented a multi-vendor architecture where each vendor manages their own products, orders, and logistics.
- Built a scalable multilingual system to support dynamic language expansion.
- Developed an order and delivery management system for real-time updates and same-day fulfillment.
- Integrated Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to handle push notifications for order statuses and promotions.
- Created robust admin and vendor APIs for inventory control, order handling, and performance tracking.
