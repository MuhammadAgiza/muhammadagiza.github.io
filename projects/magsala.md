- Designed the full **order lifecycle**: creation, approval, preparation, pickup, delivery, and completion.  
- Implemented **multi-language support** (Arabic/English) for all user-facing content.  
- Integrated MySQL database models with clean, scalable architecture.  
- Added validations, business logic, and secure authentication flows for customers, stores, and drivers.
